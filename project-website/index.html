              I (Mike) and my fellow developers Asuman and Isaac have worked on several software projects, but this time round we present a reminder
              app we called 'Avis'which will solve the problem of Forgetfulness in the today`s busy world.

              Today, people have many activities throughout the day, ranging from a small thing to many other big things. Many of the applications on the smart phone is used to manage time efficiently throughout the day. But, most of the existing applications do not have scheduled notifications capabilities. In this project, we propose an application to solve the problem of forgetfulness. The app is designed to be an easy-to-use application with the main goal of helping users to remind about the special events in their busy life by providing timely or locational alerts. All functions of the app are combined to provide the best reminder system, which suits for everyone. Users usually have trouble remembering a range of jobs, appointments, and important events as a result of their hectic lives. 
              They also regularly misplace items. As a result, there is pandemonium because people miss appointments and deadlines. we opted to develop Reminder software app that effectively addresses these problems and provides a mechanism to manage and prioritize reminders is vital. Users would be able to easily produce and customize reminders for particular days and times. The app would also provide flexibility in terms of notification options, such as push notifications, alarms, to ensure that users receive pertinent and helpful alerts. The goal is to give clients a reliable and useful reminder tool that helps them stay organized, fulfill deadlines, and maintain a productive schedule.

            <p class="text">
              However, they are bunch of schedule reminder applications available today providing static notification to user at specified interval of time. Also, this could cause delays in arriving at event location or even missing an event. 
              Reminder App is a solution to the above problem. This is a location-based reminder application and scheduled-based which dynamically notifies user so that they can be on or before time for an event.

            <p class="text">
              The problem/challenge we are aiming to solve with the development of a Reminder software app (Avis) is the increasing difficulty individuals face in managing their busy schedules and remembering important tasks and appointments. 
              In today's fast-paced world, people often have multiple responsibilities and commitments, making it challenging to keep track of everything. Forgetting crucial appointments or deadlines can have significant consequences, such as missed opportunities, strained relationships, or financial losses.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              By developing a Reminder software app, we seek to address this problem by providing users with a reliable and efficient tool to manage their reminders effectively. 
              The app will offer a centralized platform where users can set reminders for various tasks, events, or deadlines, ensuring that they stay organized and never miss an important commitment. This app's importance lies in its ability to alleviate the stress and anxiety associated with managing a hectic schedule, ultimately improving productivity, enhancing time management skills, and fostering a sense of control and confidence in users' lives.

              Avis app offers a unique solution to address the challenges faced by users in managing their schedules as key to solve the problem of Forgetfulness. 
              In addition to providing traditional reminder functionalities, our app goes a step further by allowing users to set the location where the activity needs to be done and providing them with the ability to view the weather for that location. By incorporating date and time-based reminders, location-based reminders and weather view, our app enhances users' planning and preparation capabilities. Users can set reminders for specific tasks or events tied to a particular location, ensuring they are reminded at the right place and time. Moreover, knowing the weather for that location enables users to make informed decisions and adjust their plans accordingly. For example, if a user like a student has a reminder to go for a morning lecture at the University, they can view the current weather of the location of interest.

              The feature set of location-based reminders, scheduled-based reminders (date and time) and weather view distinguishes our Reminder software app from conventional options. 
              It empowers users to better organize their activities, adapt to changing circumstances, and maximize their productivity while effectively addressing the challenges of managing a busy schedule hence solving the problem of Forgetfulness.
